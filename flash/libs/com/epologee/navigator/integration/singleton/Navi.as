	 * 
	 * If you want to use the Navigator in a singleton pattern, you can use this class for accessing the instance.
	 * 
	 * The naming is short, I know, but since you'd be accessing the singleton in lots of places, I wanted to prevent
	 * having a long expression like SingletonNavigator.instance.requestState().
	 * 
	 * Therefore I had some fun with the naming, you can access the singleton instance like with:
	 * 
	 *   Navi.instance
	 *   or
	 *   Navi.gator
	 *   
	 *   and
	 *   
	 *   Navi.instance.request();
	 *   or
	 *   Navi.gator.request();
	 * 
	 * And if you want to use a subclass of the Navigator, for example SWFAddressNavigator, you should precede the
	 * very first call to '.instance' with a call like this:
	 * 
	 *   Navi.NavigatorClass = SWFAddressNavigator
